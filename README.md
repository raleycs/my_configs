# My configurations
My personal preferences for .vimrc + .zshrc

## Terminal theme
[Smyck](https://github.com/hukl/Smyck-Color-Scheme/)

## .vimrc
`cp .vimrc ~/.vimrc`
Note that [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) needs to be installed as well

## .zshrc
`cp .zshrc ~/.zshrc`
`cp .zsh ~/.zsh`
